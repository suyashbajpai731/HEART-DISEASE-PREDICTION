# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION
Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
I have used many different algorithms like logistic regression, naive bayes, SVM.Highest model accuracy of the problem is 85.2%.
